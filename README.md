# Advances-in-Volatility-Modelling-the-costs-and-benefits-of-Synthetic-Data-for-Global-banks
This paper presents a novel approach for generating synthetic stock data using Condi-tional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs) to enhance volatility modelling and risk assessment. 

Key Components:

1. Data Generation and Training:
The code shows training of a CGAN across 5000 epochs, with outputs showing generator and discriminator losses. The decreasing discriminator loss (from ~0.9 to ~0.4) suggests the model is learning to generate increasingly realistic financial data.

Math behind CGAN:
The CGAN loss functions can be expressed as:

$$L_D = -\mathbb{E}_{x \sim p_{data}}[\log D(x|y)] - \mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_z}[\log(1-D(G(z|y)))]$$
$$L_G = \mathbb{E}_{z \sim p_z}[\log(1-D(G(z|y)))]$$

Where:
- D(x|y) is the discriminator output for real data x given condition y
- G(z|y) is the generator output from noise z given condition y
- p_data is the real data distribution
- p_z is the noise distribution

2. Statistical Analysis:
The code performs extensive statistical comparison between original and synthetic data:

Basic Statistics:
```python
# For both original and synthetic data
mean = data.mean()
std = data.std()
quantiles = data.quantile([0.25, 0.50, 0.75])
```

3. Volatility Analysis:
The code calculates rolling volatility using:

$$\sigma_t = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n(r_i - \bar{r})^2}$$

Where:
- σt is volatility at time t
- ri are returns
- r̄ is mean return
- n is window size

4. Risk Metrics:
Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) calculations:

$$VaR_{\alpha} = -\inf\{l: P(L > l) \leq \alpha\}$$
$$CVaR_{\alpha} = -\frac{1}{\alpha}\int_0^{\alpha}VaR_{\gamma}(L)d\gamma$$

5. Spectral Analysis:
The code performs frequency domain analysis using spectral density estimation:

$$S_{xx}(f) = \lim_{T \to \infty} \mathbb{E}\left[\left|\frac{1}{\sqrt{T}}\int_{-T/2}^{T/2} x(t)e^{-2\pi ift}dt\right|^2\right]$$

6. Distribution Analysis:
Includes calculation of higher moments:

Skewness:
$$\gamma_1 = \frac{\mathbb{E}[(X-\mu)^3]}{\sigma^3}$$

Kurtosis:
$$\gamma_2 = \frac{\mathbb{E}[(X-\mu)^4]}{\sigma^4}$$

Let me show a visualization to help explain the CGAN architecture:

The results show several key findings:

1. Statistical Alignment: The synthetic data maintains similar statistical properties to the original data, with comparable means and standard deviations across all stocks.

2. Higher Volatility: The synthetic data shows consistently higher volatility than the original data, which is evident in the volatility statistics (e.g., BARC.L synthetic volatility mean of 18.01 vs original 5.29).

3. Risk Profile Changes: The synthetic data exhibits higher VaR and CVaR values, indicating more extreme risk scenarios are being generated.

4. Spectral Properties: The synthetic data shows higher spectral density values, suggesting more pronounced cyclical patterns than the original data.

5. Distribution Characteristics: The synthetic data generally shows higher skewness and lower kurtosis than the original data, indicating a shift in the shape of the return distributions.

The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test results (K-S statistics near 0.35-0.40 with p-values < 0.05) suggest that while the synthetic data captures many features of the original data, there are still statistically significant differences in their distributions.

This implementation appears to be particularly focused on preserving the risk and volatility characteristics of the financial time series while potentially sacrificing some distributional accuracy for the sake of generating more diverse scenarios.

Would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect of the analysis or provide more detailed mathematical explanations for specific components?
